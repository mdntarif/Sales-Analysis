## Project Overview

The **Excel Sales Analysis Project** aims to extract, transform, and analyze sales data to provide actionable insights. The final report includes customer performance analysis and market performance benchmarks, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.

## Data Pipeline

This project follows a structured **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** process to handle raw data, organize it, and build reports. The data pipeline consists of data modeling, calculations, and report design, leading to insightful visualizations.

## Steps in Analysis

### 1. **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**

   - **Extract**: Import raw data files into Excel.
   - **Transform**: Clean and organize data using Power Query, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
   - **Load**: Load cleaned data into Excel tables, preparing it for analysis.

### 2. **Solution Design Thought Process**

   - Define objectives for each analysis, from customer segmentation to market performance.
   - Plan the analytical framework and KPIs to derive valuable insights.

### 3. **Connect Tables Using Data Modeling**

   - Use Excelâ€™s Data Model to create relationships between tables.
   - Establish connections between sales, customer, and date tables, allowing for flexible analysis across multiple data dimensions.

### 4. **Create dim_date Using Power Query**

   - Generate a custom date dimension (dim_date) table in Power Query.
   - The dim_date table enables time-based analysis and supports date-specific filtering.

### 5. **Creating Customer Performance Report**

   - Analyze customer sales performance, identifying top customers, retention rates, and sales trends.
   - This report provides insights into customer loyalty and growth opportunities.

### 6. **Report Design**

   - Organize data visualizations and tables into a clean, user-friendly layout.
   - Ensure the design is intuitive, highlighting critical insights for quick decision-making.

### 7. **Market Performance vs Targets**

   - Evaluate overall market performance, comparing sales outcomes against pre-defined targets.
   - Use KPIs and visuals to illustrate performance gaps and achievements.

## Technologies Used

- **Microsoft Excel**
  - Power Query for data transformation
  - Data Model for table connections
  - Pivot tables and charts for analysis and reporting

## Conclusion

This Excel Sales Analysis project provides a scalable framework for sales data analysis, offering insights into customer behavior and market performance. The structured approach and use of Excel features make it adaptable for various business needs, supporting effective decision-making.
